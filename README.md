Royal Gold is a simple proof of concept for the AI-powered crypto auto-trading platform with portfolio and budget management.

Concept idea:
- Gemini AI Nano is available on device and provides powerful tool for AI-powered analytics
- Most of modern crypto platforms provide APIs for both trading and tracking of price action and trends (CoinMarketCap, Alpaca, Kraken, etc.)
- For effective auto-trading platform like RG will need core indicators like RSI, MACD, Volume etc.
- Having both trend (price action), and indicators (RSI, MACD, Volume) it's easy to identify top movers and trigger automated buy/sell actions.
- In modern world crypto can be used for purchases same as fiat - and therefore budgeting could be made based on crypto portfolio
- Main difference between crypto and fiat budget management is volatility of crypto assets - which is easily trackable having market data from crypto platform APIs

Core features/screens:
- Portfolio: Review dynamics of portfolio with glanceable charts, apply AI-powered suggestions for reallocation, based on market trends.
- Budget: Review budget and expenses with glanceable charts, optimize spendings and reorganize budget using AI-powered optimization suggestions.
- Expense tracking: Track expenses automatically with linked PayPal or portfolio transactions, scan paper receipts directly to expenses list
- Market: review top movers, trends and AI-powered suggestion for trading, use fully automated trading when it is available

Project is currently in active development - many features will be added soon.
